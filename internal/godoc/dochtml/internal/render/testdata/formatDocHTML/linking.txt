Linking of URLs, RFCs, symbols and packages.
The symbol and package links work because the function is called on the stdlib time package.

Package tls partially implements TLS 1.2, as specified in RFC 5246, and TLS 1.3, as specified in RFC 8446.

In TLS 1.3, this type is called NamedGroup, but at this time this library only supports Elliptic Curve based groups. See RFC 8446, Section 4.2.7.

TLSUnique contains the tls-unique channel binding value (see RFC
5929, section 3). The newline-separated RFC should be linked, but the words RFC and RFCs should not be.

Links to [Month] and [Time.After].

Links to [time] and [github.com/a/b].
